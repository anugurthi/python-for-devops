# Day 13 · Automating SonarQube with Python

Today we will learn how to create SonarQube projects using Python. SonarQube is a tool that checks your code for bugs and quality issues.

## What You Will Learn

-   **SonarQube API:** How to create SonarQube projects programmatically.
-   **Code Quality:** Understanding why we check code quality automatically.

## Instructions

1.  **Setup:** You need access to a SonarQube server and an admin token.
2.  **Run Example:** Look at the example scripts in `examples/` to see how to create SonarQube projects.
3.  **Why This Matters:** SonarQube finds bugs in your code before they reach production.

## Checklist

-   [ ] I understand what SonarQube does (finds bugs and code smells).
-   [ ] I can see how Python can automate SonarQube project creation.

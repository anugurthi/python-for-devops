# Day 12 · Automating Jenkins with Python

Today we will learn how to create Jenkins jobs using Python instead of manually clicking through Jenkins.

## What You Will Learn

-   **Jenkins API:** How to create and trigger Jenkins jobs programmatically.
-   **CI/CD:** Understanding how Jenkins automates building and testing code.

## Instructions

1.  **Setup:** You need access to a Jenkins server and an API token.
2.  **Run Example:** Look at the example scripts in `examples/` to see how to create Jenkins jobs.
3.  **Why This Matters:** In DevOps, we create hundreds of Jenkins jobs. Automating this saves hours of manual work.

# Day 2 · Data Types & Strings

Today we will learn about the different types of data Python can handle, like text (strings) and numbers (integers/floats).

## What You Will Learn

-   **Strings:** How to work with text.
-   **Numbers:** How to do math with integers and decimals.
-   **Regex:** How to find patterns in text (like finding an email address in a log file).

## Instructions

1.  **Read:** Open `01-data-types.md` to learn the basics.
2.  **Run Examples:** Go to the `examples/` folder and run the scripts to see them in action.
    ```bash
    cd examples
    python3 01-string-concat.py
    ```
3.  **Experiment:** Try changing the text in the scripts and running them again.

## Checklist

-   [ ] I know the difference between a String ("text") and an Integer (123).
-   [ ] I can combine two strings together.
-   [ ] I can use a "regex" to find a word in a sentence.

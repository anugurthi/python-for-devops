# Day 14 · Automating AWS with Python

Today we will learn how to list and manage AWS resources (like servers and storage) using Python.

## What You Will Learn

-   **boto3:** The Python library for talking to AWS.
-   **AWS Resources:** How to list EC2 instances (servers) and S3 buckets (storage).
-   **Tags:** How to check if resources are properly labeled.

## Instructions

1.  **Setup:** You need AWS credentials configured on your computer (ask your team how to set this up).
2.  **Run Example:** Look at the example scripts in `examples/` to see how to list AWS resources.
3.  **Why This Matters:** Companies have thousands of AWS resources. Python helps you manage them at scale.

## Checklist

-   [ ] I understand what EC2 and S3 are (servers and storage).
-   [ ] I can see how Python can list and check AWS resources.
